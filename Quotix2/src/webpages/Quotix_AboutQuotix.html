		<p>Quotix is a group project that was started by a team of six college students from the University of Wisconsin-Stout. We are a bunch of movie-loving people 
		who came together and wanted to create a platform that allowed us to search up our favorite movie quotes and find information about the quote.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<b><p style = "float:left">Updates</p></b>
		<br><br><br>
		<p>Currently, Quotix is in pre-alpha phase. But we are optimistic we shall have a testing/alpha phase sometime soon for our users to try out! Keep checking the site to 
		learn when the testing phase will begin!</p>
